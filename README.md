# code-htaccess

.htaccess files (or "distributed configuration files") provide a way to make configuration changes on a per-directory basis. A file, containing one or more configuration directives, is placed in a particular document directory, and the directives apply to that directory, and all subdirectories thereof.

In simpler words, .htaccess is used to remove the .html, .php, or any other extensions from a URL.
